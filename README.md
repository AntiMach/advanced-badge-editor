# Advanced badge editor
An advanced 3DS Badge Editor

## Features
This app lets you edit your BadgeData.dat and BadgeMngFile.dat files with ease!
Make sure that both files are in the same directory when openning them with the editor.

It also lets you create badge data, but you will need to know your NNID number if you want to use the badges.

Create your own badges and sets easily, by clicking a button and importing a PNG image!
You can also import badge data from *.prb files and set data from *.cab files.
